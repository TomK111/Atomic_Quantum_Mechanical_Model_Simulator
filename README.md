# Particle Simulator
This is a particle simulator using SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer) and C++. This application simulates how electrons behave and move around atoms
at the molecular level by manipulating bits on the screen. The particles change colors the longer you keep this program running.

This repository is specifically configured for Windows Operating Systems.
